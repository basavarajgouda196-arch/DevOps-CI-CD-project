# 🚀 Dockerized Application Deployment with CI/CD on AWS

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **DevOps CI/CD pipeline** for deploying a Dockerized application on AWS. It automates the process from **code commit to production deployment** using industry-standard DevOps tools and practices.

The pipeline includes:

* Source Code Management using GitHub
* Continuous Integration using Jenkins
* Containerization using Docker
* Image Registry using DockerHub
* Deployment on AWS EC2

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

* **Cloud Provider:** AWS
* **CI/CD Tool:** Jenkins
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **Container Registry:** DockerHub
* **Version Control:** GitHub
* **OS:** Amazon Linux

## ⚙ CI/CD Pipeline Stages

1. Clone source code from GitHub
2. Build Docker image
3. Push Docker image to DockerHub
4. Deploy Docker container on AWS EC2

---

## 🧪 Jenkins Pipeline Flow

* SCM Checkout
* Docker Image Build
* Docker Image Push
* Container Deployment

---

## 🐳 Docker Workflow

```bash
# Build Image
docker build -t devops-app .

# Tag Image
docker tag devops-app username/devops-app

# Push to DockerHub
docker push username/devops-app

# Run Container
docker run -d -p 80:80 username/devops-app
```

---

## 🔐 Jenkins Credentials

* DockerHub Username
* DockerHub Password
* GitHub Access Token

---

## 🌐 Deployment

The Docker container is deployed on an **AWS EC2 instance**, and the application is accessed via:

```
http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>
```

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Automate application deployment
* Implement CI/CD pipeline
* Practice DevOps workflows
* Learn Docker containerization
* Learn AWS deployment

---

## 📄 Resume Description (ATS Friendly)

* Implemented CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins for automated Dockerized application deployment on AWS.
* Built and pushed Docker images to DockerHub and deployed containers on AWS EC2.
* Automated build, test, and deployment workflow using DevOps best practices.

---

## 🎤 Interview Explanation

"I built a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins where application code is containerized using Docker, pushed to DockerHub, and automatically deployed on AWS EC2. This project demonstrates end-to-end DevOps automation."
